--The  healthcare  industry  in

South  Florida

,  like  the  rest  of  the  country,  faces  huge  challenges  in  the  year  ahead  as  major  federal  reforms  kick  in,  experts  told  about  700  people  at  a

University  of  Miami

"We  are  at  a  critical  time  in  health  policy,"  said

Mark  McClellan

,  former  head  of  the

Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services

. </p><p><b>Sentence 2</b><p>
<p> "There  are  going  to  be  some  bumps  along  the  way,"  especially  starting  in  11  months,  when  the  biggest  changes  in  the  Affordable  Care  Act  kick  in.
</p><p><b>Sentence 3</b><p>
<p>
"Bumps  may  be  understating  what  we  may  go  through,"  said

Patrick  Geraghty

Florida  Blue

,  the  state's  largest  health  insurer.
</p><p><b>Sentence 4</b><p>
<p>
They  spoke  at  the  conference  on  the  Business  of  Healthcare  Post-Election. </p><p><b>Sentence 5</b><p>
<p> The  speakers  accepted  the  federal  reforms  --  often  referred  to  as  Obamacare  --  as  not  only  inevitable  but  necessary. </p><p><b>Sentence 6</b><p>
<p> As  Tom  Daschele,  a  former  Democratic  U.S.  senator  from

South  Dakota

,  put  it,  "having  50  million  uninsured  is  just  unacceptable."
</p><p><b>Sentence 7</b><p>
<p>
But  the  reform  act,  signed  into  law  in  2010,  contains  more  than  2,000  pages,  plus  thousands  of  pages  more  of  enabling  regulations  --  details  that  will  have  major,  and  perhaps  unexpected,  impacts  on  the  healthcare  industry,  which  now  makes  up  almost  20  percent  of  the  nation's  economy.
</p><p><b>Sentence 8</b><p>
<p>
In  October,  insurance  exchanges  will  open  for  enrollment  --  groups  that  will  allow  individuals  and  small  businesses  to  purchase  policies  with  no  exclusions  for  pre-existing  conditions. </p><p><b>Sentence 9</b><p>
<p> Starting  next  January,  virtually  everyone  will  be  required  to  have  insurance,

Medicaid

will  expand  in  many  states,  and  businesses  with  more  than  50  full-time  equivalent  employees  will  be  required  to  provide  insurance  or  pay  fines.

"
</p><p><b>Sentence 10</b><p>
<p>
is  a  very  significant  date,"  said

Steven  Ullmann

,  director  of  health  policy  at  the  UM  business  school. </p><p><b>Sentence 11</b><p>
<p> He  called  reforms  "a  process"  that  will  change  over  time.
</p><p><b>Sentence 12</b><p>
<p>
"The  one  thing  we  know  is  that  healthcare  reform  will  be  reformed,"  said

Chris  Jennings
