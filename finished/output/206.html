PTI  :  Washington,  Tue  Feb  12  2013,  10:38  hrs

In  a  landmark  decision,  US  Defence  Secretary  Leon  Panetta  today  announced  to  extend  benefits  being  accorded  to  same  sex  partners  serving  within  the  American  armed  services.
</p><p><b>Sentence 2</b><p>
<p>
"It  is  a  matter  of  fundamental  equity  that  we  provide  similar  benefits  to  all  of  those  men  and  women  in  uniform  who  serve  their  country. </p><p><b>Sentence 3</b><p>
<p> The  department  already  provides  a  group  of  benefits  that  are  member-designated. </p><p><b>Sentence 4</b><p>
<p> Today,  I  am  pleased  to  announce  that  after  a  thorough  and  deliberate  review,  the  department  will  extend  additional  benefits  to  same-sex  partners  of  service  members,"  he  said.
</p><p><b>Sentence 5</b><p>
<p>
"Taking  care  of  our  service  members  and  honoring  the  sacrifices  of  all  military  families  are  two  core  values  of  this  nation. </p><p><b>Sentence 6</b><p>
<p> Extending  these  benefits  is  an  appropriate  next  step  under  current  law  to  ensure  that  all  service  members  receive  equal  support  for  what  they  do  to  protect  this  nation,"  Panetta  said.
</p><p><b>Sentence 7</b><p>
<p>
Panetta  said  one  of  the  legal  limitations  to  providing  all  benefits  at  this  time  is  the  Defense  of  Marriage  Act,  which  is  still  the  law  of  the  land.
</p><p><b>Sentence 8</b><p>
<p>
There  are  certain  benefits  that  can  only  be  provided  to  spouses  as  defined  by  that  law,  which  is  now  being  reviewed  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  he  said.
</p><p><b>Sentence 9</b><p>
<p>
"While  it  will  not  change  during  my  tenure  as  secretary  of  defence,  I  foresee  a  time  when  the  law  will  allow  the  department  to  grant  full  benefits  to  service  members  and  their  dependents,  irrespective  of  sexual  orientation. </p><p><b>Sentence 10</b><p>
<p> Until  then,  the  department  will  continue  to  comply  with  current  law  while  doing  all  we  can  to  take  care  of  all  soldiers,  sailors,  airmen,  marines,  and  their  families,"  he  said.
