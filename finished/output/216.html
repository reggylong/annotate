<p><b>Sentence 1</b><p>
<p>Former  Honolulu  Police  Department  officer  Stan  Cook

It  was  a  headline-grabbing  shooting. </p><p><b>Sentence 2</b><p>
<p> A  Honolulu  Police  officer  shot  eight  times  with  an  assault  rifle.
</p><p><b>Sentence 3</b><p>
<p>
Not  only  did  he  survive,  he  killed  the  suspect. </p><p><b>Sentence 4</b><p>
<p> Now,  Stan  Cook  is  telling  his  story  and  helping  other  officers  survive  similar  situations.
</p><p><b>Sentence 5</b><p>
<p>
It  was  a  story  that  inspired  school  children  to  write  get  well  cards.
</p><p><b>Sentence 6</b><p>
<p>
Well  wishes  for  Honolulu  Police  Department  officer  Stan  Cook  who  survived  this...

"I  was  hit  eight  times  with  an  AK-47,"  Cook  said. </p><p><b>Sentence 7</b><p>
<p> "It's  the  training,  and  the  training  has  to  be  such  that  you  don't  have  to  think  about  it  when  it  happens. </p><p><b>Sentence 8</b><p>
<p> I  remember  the  incident  after  it  was  over  I  was  kind  of  shocked  because  everything  happened  as  it  was  supposed  to."
</p><p><b>Sentence 9</b><p>
<p>
Cook  felt  so  strongly  about  the  training  that  one  year  later  he  took  part  in  a  reenactment  to  help  future  recruits.
</p><p><b>Sentence 10</b><p>
<p>
"One  of  my  solo  bike  partners,  Chaz  Tang,  was  the  driver,  and  Kawika  Towlesman,  who  runs  a  studio  in  Honolulu,  all  put  the  thing  together  and  we  did  the  reenactment  right  at  the  same  spot,"  Cook  said.
</p><p><b>Sentence 11</b><p>
<p>
And  now  it's  chronicled  in  a  book  called,  "1920  Shots  Fired,  Officer  Down."
</p><p><b>Sentence 12</b><p>
<p>
"To  express  what  happened  leading  up  to  it,  more  than  just  the  incident  itself,  and  the  aftermath  and  the  lessons  we  learned. </p><p><b>Sentence 13</b><p>
<p> So  that's  what  I  did,"  Cook  said.
</p><p><b>Sentence 14</b><p>
